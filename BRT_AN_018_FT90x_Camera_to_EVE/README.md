# ft9xx-usbd-examples / BRT_AN_018 FT90x Camera to EVE
In this example, the output from a camera module connected to the FT90x is routed to a Bridgetek EVE module display.

The demonstration relies on an OV5640 camera sensor to produce JPEG compressed video which is suitable for display on the EVE module.
This is NOT the standard camera module that is supplied with FT90x development boards that support the camera interface.
